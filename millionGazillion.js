/*
I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillion™.
I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database, and follows links to other web pages. I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over, so I made a set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited. Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.

Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' basement (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.

How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?

Replacing common substrings like ".com" and "www" with characters that aren't allowed in URLs definitely wins us something, 
but we can do even better. How can we even further exploit overlaps or shared prefixes between URLs?

*/

//Use a trie (nested objects) to store prefixes that had already been stored previously and add to the tree only if a new url
//is present 

function Trie() {
    this.rootNode = {};
}

Trie.prototype.checkPresentAndAdd = function(word) {

    var currentNode = this.rootNode;
    var isNewWord = false;

    // Work downwards through the trie, adding nodes
    // as needed, and keeping track of whether we add
    // any nodes.
    for (var i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        var char = word[i];

        if (!currentNode.hasOwnProperty(char)) {
            isNewWord = true;
            currentNode[char] = {};
        }

        currentNode = currentNode[char];
    }

    // Explicitly mark the end of a word.
    // Otherwise, we might say a word is
    // present if it is a prefix of a different,
    // longer word that was added earlier.
    if (!currentNode.hasOwnProperty("End of Word")) {
        isNewWord = true;
        currentNode["End of Word"] = {};
    }

    return isNewWord;
}
