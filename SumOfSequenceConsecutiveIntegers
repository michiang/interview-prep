/**
Most positive numbers can be written as the sum of a sequence of consecutive positive integers. For instance,

6 = 1 + 2 + 3 
9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4

but there is no such sequence for 8.

Write a function that takes in a number and prints out all the possible consecutive sequences that add up to it.  If there are no such sequences, print an error message.

  //Keep track of the total

  //If our total is greater than the integer input, then break out of the current iteration and move on to the next number in the sequence
